# TechGeneralist UI Web Component Library

The intention of this libarary is to offer a set of reusable UI web components
that "feel" like Bootstrap, are built on the flexibility of Tailwind CSS, and
are extensible to libs like React, Angular, or just the plain old web.

## Yet Another UI Library?

I've built many different websites and I generally end up rebuilding things like
layouts and different widgets of all sorts. This library is just for me to reuse
with my personal projects. If others find it helpful fantasctic but this is to
scratch my own itch.

## How to suppor this work.
